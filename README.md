Hacks, here, refer to small programs that might not solve a bigger problem.
This would contain programs that I create for fun. These might include programs
to try out some new algorithm (but aren't good enough to fit in any other
repository of mine) and programs that I try for learning and teaching (yes, I
might want to use some of these code samples as examples elsewhere).
